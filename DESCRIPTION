Description: This package provides three functions to run CJS models correcting for survivorship bias.    
             There are three CJS models implemented in this R package, Mh, Mah, and Math.     
             In all cases recapture can be set to be constant or indclude age-dependence. 
             In Mah and Math models survival is age-dependent (although could be constant if you set 
             age classes to be 1) and Math model include temporal dependence on survival.
